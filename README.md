You probably want to just install [Overkill for Mac](https://github.com/KrauseFx/overkill-for-mac)

# iTunes Sniper

![Neat](./neat.gif)

Any time iTunes tries to open, kill it and open Spotify.

It's a node script. Run it with `node index.js`.

Someone make this into a startup script? Or nice little electron app?

# Electron App Version

This is the inital idea about the electron app. Feel free to create new issues and contribute.

Move to electron directory `cd electron`. Then install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn` and run the app with `yarn start` or `npm start` ``
